# Bug Fix Verification: Phase Positioning

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Users could only move phase rectangles within approximately half of the canvas area.
**Root Cause**: Hardcoded canvas bounds (1200x800) in `updatePhasePosition` function that didn't match the new doubled canvas size.

## Fix Applied
```javascript
// OLD CODE (buggy):
newX = Math.max(0, Math.min(newX, 1200 - phase.width));
newY = Math.max(0, Math.min(newY, 800 - phase.height));

// NEW CODE (fixed):
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const canvasWidth = canvas.offsetWidth || canvas.clientWidth;
const canvasHeight = canvas.offsetHeight || canvas.clientHeight;
newX = Math.max(0, Math.min(newX, canvasWidth - phase.width));
newY = Math.max(0, Math.min(newY, canvasHeight - phase.height));
```

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. **Load the Graph Editor**
   - Open `graph-editor.html` in your browser
   - Canvas should now show as 2x extended size with grid pattern

### 2. **Enable Debug Mode (Optional)**
   - Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
   - In Console, type: `window.debugPhasePositioning = true`
   - This will show canvas dimensions and position constraints in console

### 3. **Create a Phase Rectangle**
   - Drag "ðŸ“¦ Phase" from the sidebar to the canvas
   - Drop it anywhere on the canvas

### 4. **Test Full Canvas Movement**
   - Select the phase rectangle (click on it)
   - Try dragging it to ALL areas of the canvas:
     - **Top-left corner** of the extended canvas
     - **Top-right corner** of the extended canvas  
     - **Bottom-left corner** of the extended canvas
     - **Bottom-right corner** of the extended canvas
     - **Center areas** of the extended canvas

### 4. **Scroll and Test**
   - Use scrollbars to navigate to different parts of the canvas
   - Create phases in different canvas areas
   - Move existing phases between distant canvas locations

### 5. **Verify Constraint Behavior**
   - Phases should be constrained to stay within canvas bounds
   - But now they can use the FULL canvas area (not just half)
   - Phases shouldn't disappear or get stuck at invisible barriers

## Expected Results After Fix
- âœ… **Full canvas access**: Phases can be positioned anywhere within the 2x canvas area
- âœ… **Proper bounds checking**: Phases still can't be dragged outside canvas edges  
- âœ… **Dynamic sizing**: Positioning constraints adapt to actual canvas dimensions
- âœ… **Smooth movement**: No invisible barriers or restricted zones
- âœ… **Scroll compatibility**: Positioning works correctly when canvas is scrolled

## Test Scenarios
1. **Small Phase**: Drag a standard 200x150 phase to all canvas corners
2. **Large Phase**: Resize a phase to be larger, then test movement constraints
3. **Multiple Phases**: Create several phases and move them around simultaneously
4. **Edge Cases**: Try to drag phases beyond canvas boundaries (should be prevented)

## What Was Broken Before
- Phases could only be moved within ~1200x800 pixel area (old canvas size)
- Attempting to drag beyond this caused phases to "stick" at invisible boundaries
- Users couldn't utilize the full 2x extended canvas space for layout

## Technical Details
- **Function Modified**: `updatePhasePosition()` in `graph-editor.js`
- **Change Type**: Dynamic canvas size detection instead of hardcoded values
- **Impact**: Fixes positioning for current 200vw x 200vh canvas (minimum 2000x1400px)
- **Future-proof**: Will automatically adapt if canvas size changes again

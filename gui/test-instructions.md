# Testing Enhanced Drag-and-Drop Graph Editor

## New Features Added
- âœ… **Smaller, closer drag icons** - Drag icons are now 60% smaller and positioned just 10px from cursor
- âœ… **Double-sized canvas** - Canvas is now 2x viewport size with minimum 2000x1400px
- âœ… **Smart scrollbars** - Auto-appearing scrollbars when content exceeds screen size
- âœ… **Grid background** - Subtle grid pattern to help with positioning and scale reference

## Instructions to Test Enhanced Features

### 1. **Open the Graph Editor**
   - Open `graph-editor.html` in your web browser
   - Notice the "Canvas: 2x Extended" indicator in the toolbar
   - The canvas now has a subtle grid pattern background

### 2. **Test Improved Drag Icons**
   - Drag the "ðŸ”´ Node" component from the sidebar
   - **Observe**: The drag icon is now much smaller and stays close to your cursor
   - **Observe**: The icon appears right next to the cursor instead of centered on it

### 3. **Test Large Canvas & Scrollbars**
   - Try scrolling within the canvas area using:
     - Mouse wheel (vertical scroll)
     - Shift + mouse wheel (horizontal scroll) 
     - Drag the scrollbars on the right and bottom edges
   - **Observe**: Smooth scrolling reveals the extended canvas area
   - **Observe**: Grid pattern helps visualize the larger workspace

### 4. **Test Drag-and-Drop Node Creation**
   - Load sample data first: Click "Load Sample" 
   - Scroll around to see the phase rectangles
   - Drag "ðŸ”´ Node" from sidebar and drop into any phase rectangle
   - **Observe**: Drop zones still highlight with blue borders during drag
   - **Observe**: Nodes are created at precise drop locations

### 5. **Test Canvas Navigation**
   - Use scrollbars to navigate the 2x larger canvas
   - Try creating phases and nodes in different areas
   - **Observe**: All functionality works across the extended canvas area

## Visual Feedback Improvements
- **Enhanced Drag Experience**: Smaller, more precise drag icons that don't obstruct view
- **Extended Workspace**: 2x larger canvas provides more room for complex diagrams
- **Professional Scrollbars**: Custom-styled scrollbars that blend with the UI
- **Grid Reference**: Subtle grid helps with alignment and spatial awareness

## Canvas Specifications
- **Size**: 200% of viewport width/height (minimum 2000x1400px)
- **Background**: White with 50px grid pattern
- **Scrollbars**: Auto-appearing with custom styling
- **Navigation**: Smooth scrolling in all directions

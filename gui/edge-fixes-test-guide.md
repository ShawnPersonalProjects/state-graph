# Edge Functionality Fixes - Test Guide

## Issues Fixed
1. âœ… **Self-directed edge positioning** - Now always appear outside the node
2. âœ… **Self-directed edge creation** - Users can now create self-directed edges  
3. âœ… **Edge deletion** - Users can now properly select and delete edges

## Detailed Fixes Applied

### 1. Self-Directed Edge Positioning Fix
**Problem**: Self-directed edges were not always clearly outside the node
**Solution**: Enhanced the self-loop rendering algorithm

```javascript
// NEW: Better positioned self-loops
const loopRadius = nodeRadius * 1.5; // Larger for visibility
const offset = nodeRadius + loopRadius + 5; // Ensure completely outside
// Position consistently at top-right of node
```

### 2. Self-Directed Edge Creation Fix  
**Problem**: Code prevented self-directed edges with `connectionStart !== nodeId` check
**Solution**: Removed the restriction to allow same-node connections

```javascript
// OLD (buggy):
if (connectionStart && connectionStart !== nodeId) {
    createEdge(connectionStart, nodeId);
}

// NEW (fixed):
if (connectionStart) {
    createEdge(connectionStart, nodeId);
}
```

### 3. Edge Deletion Fix
**Problem**: Edges were hard to select and delete
**Solution**: Multiple improvements for better edge interaction

- **Wider clickable area**: Added invisible 10px wide path for easier clicking
- **Visual indicators**: Added default bullet (â€¢) for edges without conditions  
- **Better selection styling**: Red highlighting when edge is selected
- **Proper event handling**: Fixed edge path classes and cursor styles

## How to Test All Edge Features

### Test 1: Self-Directed Edge Creation
1. **Open the graph editor** and load sample data
2. **Select "Connect Nodes" tool** from toolbar
3. **Click on any node** to start connection
4. **Click the same node again** to complete self-directed edge
5. **Expected**: A prominent loop should appear outside the node (top-right area)

### Test 2: Self-Directed Edge Positioning
1. **Create several self-directed edges** on different nodes
2. **Resize nodes** using resize handles
3. **Expected**: Self-loops should always stay completely outside the node boundary
4. **Expected**: Loops should be clearly visible and not overlap the node

### Test 3: Edge Selection and Visual Feedback
1. **Create both regular and self-directed edges**
2. **Click on edge paths** or labels
3. **Expected**: Selected edges should turn red with thicker stroke
4. **Expected**: Edge labels should become bold and red when selected

### Test 4: Edge Deletion Methods
1. **Method 1 - Right-click context menu**:
   - Right-click on any edge
   - Select "Delete" from context menu
   - Edge should be removed

2. **Method 2 - Select and delete**:
   - Click to select an edge (should turn red)
   - Right-click anywhere and choose "Delete"
   - Edge should be removed

### Test 5: Edge Clickability
1. **Test clicking on different parts of edges**:
   - Click on the edge path itself
   - Click on edge labels (condition text or bullet â€¢)
   - Try both straight and curved edges
2. **Expected**: All parts should be clickable and select the edge

### Test 6: Edge Labels and Identification
1. **Create edges with conditions** (double-click edge to edit)
2. **Create edges without conditions**
3. **Expected**: 
   - Edges with conditions show the condition text
   - Edges without conditions show a bullet (â€¢) for easy identification

## Visual Indicators to Look For

### Self-Directed Edges
- âœ… Clear circular loop outside the node
- âœ… Loop positioned consistently at top-right  
- âœ… Arrow pointing back to the node
- âœ… Proper scaling with node size

### Edge Selection
- âœ… Selected edges turn red with thicker stroke
- âœ… Selected edge labels turn red and bold
- âœ… Clear visual distinction from unselected edges

### Edge Interaction
- âœ… Pointer cursor when hovering over edges
- âœ… Clickable areas extend beyond visible stroke
- âœ… Context menu appears on right-click
- âœ… Smooth deletion with proper cleanup

## Technical Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Self-Loop Algorithm**: Better geometry for consistent outside positioning
2. **Removed Creation Restriction**: Allow same-node connections
3. **Improved Clickability**: Added transparent wide stroke for easier clicking
4. **Visual Feedback**: Proper CSS for selected edge states
5. **Better Labels**: Default indicators for edges without conditions
6. **Proper Event Handling**: Fixed edge group classes and event propagation

## Troubleshooting

If edges still seem unclickable:
1. Check browser developer tools for JavaScript errors
2. Ensure you're clicking directly on the edge path or label
3. Try right-clicking for context menu as alternative selection method

If self-directed edges overlap nodes:
1. Try resizing the node - loop should adjust automatically
2. Check that the node radius is being read correctly

All edge functionality should now work seamlessly with proper visual feedback! ðŸŽ‰

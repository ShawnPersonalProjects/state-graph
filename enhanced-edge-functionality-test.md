# Enhanced Edge Functionality - Test Guide

## Improvements Made

### 1. âœ… Self-Directed Edge Rendering Enhancement
**Improvement**: Self-directed edges now render as smooth half circles above nodes
**Visual**: Clean, professional arc instead of complex loops

### 2. âœ… Phase Edge Selection Fix  
**Improvement**: Phase edges are now easily clickable and selectable
**Features**: Wider clickable areas, visual indicators, better feedback

### 3. âœ… Phase Edge Deletion Fix
**Improvement**: Phase edges can now be properly deleted with cleanup
**Features**: Proper removal of control points and DOM elements

## Technical Improvements

### Self-Directed Edge Algorithm
```javascript
// NEW: Perfect half circle using SVG arc
const startAngle = Math.PI / 6; // 30 degrees from top-right  
const endAngle = 5 * Math.PI / 6; // 150 degrees to top-left
path = `M ${startX} ${startY} A ${loopRadius} ${loopRadius} 0 0 0 ${endX} ${endY}`;
```

### Phase Edge Clickability
- **Invisible clickable path**: 12px wide transparent stroke for easier targeting
- **Visual indicators**: Diamond (â—Š) symbol for phase edges without conditions
- **Enhanced selection styling**: Darker red with different dash pattern when selected

### Proper Deletion Handling
- **Dedicated deletePhaseEdge function**: Proper cleanup of control points
- **DOM element removal**: Clean removal from canvas
- **Data structure cleanup**: Proper removal from phase edges map

## How to Test All Improvements

### Test 1: Self-Directed Edge Half Circle Rendering
1. **Create nodes** in any phase
2. **Use "Connect Nodes" tool** and click same node twice
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - Smooth half circle above the node
   - Clean arc from top-right to top-left of node
   - Arrow pointing back to node
   - Label positioned at top of arc

### Test 2: Phase Edge Selection
1. **Create two phases** (drag from sidebar)
2. **Use "Connect Phases" tool** and connect them
3. **Test clicking on phase edges**:
   - Click directly on the dashed red line
   - Click on the diamond (â—Š) indicator or condition text
   - **Expected**: Phase edge should be selected (highlighted with darker red)

### Test 3: Phase Edge Visual Feedback
1. **Create phase edges with and without conditions**
2. **Observe visual indicators**:
   - Edges with conditions show condition text
   - Edges without conditions show diamond (â—Š) symbol
3. **Test selection highlighting**:
   - Selected phase edges should have darker red color
   - Dash pattern should become tighter (3,3 instead of 5,5)
   - Labels should become bold

### Test 4: Phase Edge Deletion
1. **Create several phase edges**
2. **Method 1 - Right-click deletion**:
   - Right-click on phase edge
   - Select "Delete" from context menu
   - Phase edge should be removed completely

3. **Method 2 - Select and delete**:
   - Click to select a phase edge (should turn darker red)
   - Right-click anywhere and choose "Delete" 
   - Phase edge should be removed

### Test 5: Edge Interaction Comparison
1. **Create both node edges and phase edges**
2. **Compare interaction**:
   - Both should be easily clickable
   - Both should show proper selection highlighting
   - Both should delete cleanly via context menu

## Visual Indicators to Look For

### Self-Directed Edges
- âœ… **Perfect half circle** positioned above node
- âœ… **Smooth arc** from 30Â° to 150Â° around node circumference
- âœ… **Proper scaling** - loop size proportional to node radius (1.8x)
- âœ… **Clean positioning** - label at top of arc

### Phase Edge Selection
- âœ… **Clickable area** extends beyond visible line
- âœ… **Diamond indicators** (â—Š) for edges without conditions
- âœ… **Darker red highlighting** when selected (#c0392b)
- âœ… **Tighter dash pattern** (3,3) when selected

### Phase Edge Deletion
- âœ… **Complete removal** from canvas
- âœ… **Control point cleanup** if edge was curved
- âœ… **No leftover artifacts** or broken references

## Before vs After Comparison

### Self-Directed Edges
**Before**: Complex quadratic curves with multiple control points
**After**: Clean SVG arc with perfect half circle geometry

### Phase Edge Selection  
**Before**: Difficult to click, required precise targeting
**After**: Easy to click with wide transparent clickable area

### Phase Edge Deletion
**Before**: Simple deletion that might leave artifacts
**After**: Proper cleanup with dedicated deletion function

## Advanced Features

### Self-Directed Edge Positioning
- Uses mathematical precision for perfect arcs
- Automatically scales with node size
- Consistent positioning regardless of node location

### Phase Edge Interaction
- Visual feedback on hover (pointer cursor)
- Wide clickable tolerance for user-friendly interaction  
- Proper event propagation and selection handling

### Deletion Robustness
- Handles both regular edges and phase edges appropriately
- Cleans up all related data structures
- Removes all visual elements completely
